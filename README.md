I'm a born Software Developer with experience spanning over the last 18 of my 30 years. My skills are focused on the "Open Web Platform" and various web-server platforms: PHP, Perl, and, most notably, node.js. I adapt easily to new languages, environments and interfaces, and have a range of experience outside of the web domain, i.e. desktop and mobile applications. I have a strong talent for leveraging the open-source community, and a passion for creating a high-end user experience.
